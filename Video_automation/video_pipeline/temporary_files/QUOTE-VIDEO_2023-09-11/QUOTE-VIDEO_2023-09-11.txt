Stars are like the memories of the universe, each one a glimpse into it's past. The mind as a canvas and thoughts are the brush strokes that paint our reality in the symphony of life. Each experience plays a note that resonates through eternity. Time is a river and we are the stones that shape it's flow. The dance of chaos and order births the cosmos. A smile is the gravitational pull of happiness on the fabric of existence. Echoes remind us that even sound leaves a piece of itself behind.
